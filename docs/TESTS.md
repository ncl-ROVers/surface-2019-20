# Creating tests for Python using Pytest

## Install Pytest

Run the following command from the command line:
'''
pip install -U pytest
'''

## Using Pytest

-Test files and test functions must contain:
  test_* or _*test
so that Pytest can automatically detect the tests

-You can then run pytest from the command line using:
  '''
  pytest *directory*
  '''
