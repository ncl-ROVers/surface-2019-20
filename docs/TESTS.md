# Creating tests for Python using Pytest

## Install Pytest

Run the following command from the command line:
```
pip install -U pytest
```

## Using Pytest

-Test files and test functions must contain:
  ```test_*``` or ```_*test```
so that Pytest can automatically detect the tests

-You can then run pytest from the command line using:
  ```
  pytest *directory*
  ```
  or
  ```
  pytest *test-file*
  ```
