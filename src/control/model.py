Control Model
=============

Module storing an implementation of the control model.

The `ControlManager` class is the implementation of a closed loop control system for the ROV, with the readings
from both the manual and the autonomous modes.
TODO: Conversion from normalised ranges to expected hardware values is needed (and associated code).

class ControlManager:
    """
    Control managed used to decide which values should be transmitted to the PI based on the readings from manual
    and autonomous data.

    The process of getting the final values is as follows:

    1. Pull the readings from manual and autonomous control systems.
    2. Merge the readings depending on the driving mode.
    3. Translate the merged readings into proper hardware values.
    4. Push the final values to the shared memory as transmission data.

    .. note::
        The final readings are always sub-ranges between -1 to 1 inclusive. Some example ranges are <-1, 1>, <0, 1>.
        It is up to the translation code to convert them to values understood by the ROV's hardware.

    Functions
    ---------

    The following list shortly summarises each function:

        * __init__ - standard constructor
        * _pull - a method to get the data from manual and autonomous control systems
        * _merge - a method to merge both control systems
        * _push - a method to convert the values into the final format and update shared memory
        * _update - a wrapper method to execute everything in a separate process
        * start - a method to start the control model's calculations

    Usage
    -----

    After creating an instance of the class, `start` method will return a process ID of the started process.
