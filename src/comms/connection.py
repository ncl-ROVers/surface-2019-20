class Connection:
    """
    Connection class used as a two-way data exchange medium.

    Handles sending transmission data to ROV and receiving information back.

    Functions
    ---------

    The following list shortly summarises each function:

        * __init__ - a constructor to create and initialise socket and process related constructs
        * status - a getter to retrieve current connection status
        * connected - a getter to check if the communication is still happening
        * connect - a method used to connect with the ROV (spawns separate thread)
        * _connect - a method used to connect with the ROV
        * disconnect - a method used to disconnect with the ROV
        * reconnect - a helper method used to disconnect and connect in one step
        * _communicate - a private method which does the actual communication with the ROV (send and recv)
        * _new_socket - a private method which re-initialises the socket
        * _new_process - a private method which re-initialises the process
        * _cleanup - a private method used to (attempt to) clean-up the resources

    Usage
    -----

    The connection should be created as follows::

        connection = Connection()
        connection.connect()

    While working, the code should check if the communication is happening, to detect when it stops::

        if not connection.connected():
            connection.reconnect()

    Once finished, to cleanup the resources, a disconnection should happen::

        connection.disconnect()

    Note that the operating system should be capable of cleaning up any incorrectly closed sockets (upon
    server-initiated disconnection, the sockets must (at least) go into the TIME_WAIT state), but the processes will not
    be cleaned and persist as zombie processes.

    .. warning::

        The calling functions must handle when the attempts to connect, disconnect etc. should be made, and detect when
        the communication stops (for example by checking the status). This is NOT handled internally.
