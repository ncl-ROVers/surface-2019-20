class VideoStream:
    """
    Video stream class used as a stream receiver.

    Handles fetching frames from a remote address in OpenCV format and their conversion to QT format.

    Functions
    ---------

    The following list shortly summarises each function:

        * __init__ - a constructor to create and initialise video capture and thread related constructs
        * frame - a getter used to retrieve the frame in OpenCV format
        * frame_qt - a getter used to retrieve the frame in QT format
        * shape - a property used to get or set the resolution of the frame
        * _read - helper method to read the frames in a thread

    Usage
    -----

    The stream object should be created as follows::

        stream = VideoStream(URL)

    where `URL` is a valid url in string format.


    ..warning::

        The frame reading process will start immediately, and it's up to the calling code to decide when to use them.
